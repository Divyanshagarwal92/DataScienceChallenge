Python Libraries:
1. Numpy
2. Matplotlib
3. Scikit-learn
4. NLTK
5. gensim

Usage:
1. ./data.py 
( takes 5 mins to run)
2. ./testing-setup.py

Instructions:
data.py: 
	1. Loads the data
	2. Gets word2vec features for each sentence using pre-trained word2vec model 'GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin'
	3. The features and the labels are saved as numpy variables in 'features.npy' and 'labels.npy'


testing-setup.py: Gives the predcitions on test set based on the best classifier( Random Foresnt) and parameter setting (n_estimators = 15)

classifier_set.py:
	Describes the different classifiers used: SVM, adaptiveBoosting, DecisionTree, RandomForest.
	This code was also used to run various experiments for a given classifier to obtain the best parameter setting
